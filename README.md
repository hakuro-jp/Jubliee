Changes I made during my Jubilee build.  The camera parts work with the Automatic Tool Brush (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4310801), the bracket screws into the left upper screw hole to attach to the power supply screws on the Jubilee back.  The C270 adaptor screws into the brush arm to allow attaching a Logitech C270 camera and the Motor Slider Post replaces the original Slider Post with brass inserts that allow for repeated disassembly (A feature often present on the Jubilee).
